          <p>My father has been working on DIY projects for as long as I can remember. Somewhere along the line I picked up the hobby and now I build a lot of the furniture I use. My most recent project was a knife box for my chef's knife and before that I made a bookcase specifically for my non-fiction books.</p>

          <p>In 2018 I started playing the classic RPG Morrowind as recomended to me by my friend Alex. I quickly fell in love with the world and as I knew that Bethesda had the creation tools available for modders I wondered if I too could create mods for now one of my favourite games.
            It turns out that I could in fact do this and I proceded to create a multitude of small mods ranging from quality of life improvements, new buildings, new characters and scripting mods.</p>

          <p>I have been cooking ever since my parents trusted me to be in the kitchen by myself, making all sorts of dishes. I follow many chefs and cooks on social media and on youtube where I try my best to learn from their recipes to improve my own dishes.
            In the last year, the rise in popularity and affordability of meal subscription services has allowed me to branch out with what im comfortable cooking and I have been able to take the knowledge from the recipes I have made and use it in almost every dish. </p>
