          <h2>Historical Archery</h2>
          <p>Archery, or the use of bow and arrows, was probably developed in Africa by the later Middle Stone Age. It had been an important military and hunting tactic throughout history, and figures prominently in the mythologies of many cultures.</p>

          <h2>Modern Archery</h2>
          <p>In the modern day we have developed more effective weapons so bows are rarely seen in combat, instead being used more frequently in sporting events and in hunting. Target archery has gone from a training tool for warfare to being a sport all of its own.</p>
