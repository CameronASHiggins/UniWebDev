        <img src="Assets/Varsity Photo Shoot Pic (2).jpg" alt="Me shooting a bow">
        <p>I have always had an interest in archery but my parents would never let me have a bow, so I did what any self-respecting son would do and I just didn't tell them about it until I was invested. I started archery in 2019 when I joined the De Montfort University Archery Club and have since become the chair of the club, organising and attending many competitions and meeting fellow archers.
        New archers have joined the club and I assisted in the delivery of their beginners course and with future queries they have during club training sessions.</p>

      <h2>Videogame Modding</h2>
      <section class = "hobby">
        <img src="Assets/TES Construction Set.jpg" alt="The elder scrolls construction set logo">
        <p>In 2018 I started playing the classic RPG Morrowind as recomended to me by my friend Alex. I quickly fell in love with the world and as I knew that Bethesda had the creation tools available for modders I wondered if I too could create mods for now one of my favourite games.
        It turns out that I could in fact do this and I proceded to create a multitude of small mods ranging from quality of life improvements, new buildings, new characters and scripting mods.</p>

      <h2>Cooking</h2>
      <section class = "hobby">
        <img src="Assets/Pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza I made">
        <p>I have been cooking ever since my parents trusted me to be in the kitchen by myself, making all sorts of dishes. I follow many chefs and cooks on social media and on youtube where I try my best to learn from their recipes to improve my own dishes.
        In the last year, the rise in popularity and affordability of meal subscription services has allowed me to branch out with what im comfortable cooking and I have been able to take the knowledge from the recipes I have made and use it in almost every dish. </p>
