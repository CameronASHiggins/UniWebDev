        <p>I have always had an interest in archery but my parents would never let me have a bow, so I did what any self-respecting son would do and I just didn't tell them about it until I was invested. I started archery in 2019 when I joined the De Montfort University Archery Club and have since become the chair of the club, organising and attending many competitions and meeting fellow archers.
        New archers have joined the club and I assisted in the delivery of their beginners course and with future queries they have during club training sessions.</p>

        <p>In 2018 I started playing the classic RPG Morrowind as recomended to me by my friend Alex. I quickly fell in love with the world and as I knew that Bethesda had the creation tools available for modders I wondered if I too could create mods for now one of my favourite games.
        It turns out that I could in fact do this and I proceded to create a multitude of small mods ranging from quality of life improvements, new buildings, new characters and scripting mods.</p>
