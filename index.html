		You will need to replace this content with your own.

		Your final site should have a maximum of four HTML documents.
		Though a 'single page app' will probably have only one html file.
		Either way, your site should provide the facility to navigate around the main sections.

		Consider accessibility.
		Make sure your HTML has a clear structure.
		Use semantic elements to define the main parts of your page.

		Remember to keep the indentation consistent and VALIDATE your code regularly!

			Well, my name is Cameron but who I am is more than just my name. I am a man who's identity has been built over years of experiences and interactions.
			Like you, I am unique, but through shared interests and academia I am tasked with the development of this assignment. Thats what this is, a 4 paged portfolio on me.
